#base class

# any variables and functions that are used in ALL class of supply
# just like the Unit class, inerit off of it for each class-of-supply
# then in main.py, the pay you would use it is simply "new ClassOne(...parameters)" then
# the new object of that class-of-supply would instatiate itself and be ready to process and be
# used within a Unit class.
# save from repeating code, in general (DRY).
